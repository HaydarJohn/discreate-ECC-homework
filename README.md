# discreate-ECC-homework

this homework tried to use ecc256 to encryp strings and timed the difference between inputs.

We used "This is string to sign for project" and "This is string to sign for project ECC done by Haydarjohn , Feyiz , Muhemmet"; as a strings

Our benchmarks showed  no significant drawback to string or data length for encryption.

We tried to benchmark breaking encryption but failed. What do you expect from a encryption that USA`s top secrets encrpted from (ecdsa384) :D
